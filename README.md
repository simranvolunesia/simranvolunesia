### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Simran Kalra and I love coding, learning, teaching, thinking (generally talking to myself) and mainly, I am a spiritual person.

- ðŸ”­ I believe in VOLUNESIA
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to be better in problem solving, learn AI, DSA (M.Tech. 1st year student at IIITD)
- ðŸ’¬ I did my schooling from Swami Sant Dass Public School, Jalandhar, Punjab and my B.Tech. from T.I.E.T., Patiala, Punjab
- ðŸ“« ***How to reach me:*** Contact me directly on conceptsindepthandeasy@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really want to help people through technology. Mundane tasks can be easy via technology and I believe that whatever we create, if we are able to solve problem of even one person and we made his/her life easier, it's worth it!!
